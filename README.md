# documents
here are documents to my Capstone Project
Capstone Project is a project that consists of application, database, and documents.
So, we had a client outside College, who wanted application.
The application should store and let access to the current and former employees of the company to their personal documents, related to their activity in the company, for example salaries, education certificates, passport scan copies, etc.
My role in this project was to document all code architechture, manuals, etc.
Thus, this repository aims to reveil this work with documents.
These documents have no NDA agreement, so can be used in any purpose.
